            I'm Frontend developer with professional experience building
            efficient and scalable Web Applications and React-Native apps,
            currently living in Gdansk. I'm passionate about quality code, best
            practices, security, and performance.<br />
            On a daily basis, I work on complex front-end projects with
            up-to-date languages and technologies, and I also have a decent
            grasp of server-side development. While I enjoy experimenting with
            new frameworks and libraries, I understand the importance of placing
            focus on the end goal: delivering a beautiful, functional product to
            the user/client.<br />
